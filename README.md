## News API Project

Simple backend project to get to grips with NodeJS and Ajax requests to the [News API](https://newsapi.org/).
Made in collaboration with Larissa Casey â€“ [check her out on Github](https://github.com/risscasey)!

### Installation
To install this project you'll need to run the following terminal commands:
```sh
    $ git clone https://github.com/andybaaall/news-API-project
    $ cd news-API-project
    $ npm install
    $ node server
```

You'll need to be running a recent version of [NodeJS and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/), and open the project in a localhost environment. We've currently got it running on **port 2999**.

You'll also need a **News API Key**, which you can create for free [here](https://newsapi.org/). Once you've got that, you'll need to create a ```config.json``` file in the ```public``` folder. Then all you need to do is paste your API key in - if you get stuck, look at the ```configExample.json``` file. :)
